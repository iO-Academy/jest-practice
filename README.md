# jest practice

This repo is designed to help you practice writing jest unit tests.

The `functions.test.js` is importing the `functions.js` file which contains 3 functions for you to test.

To use this repo, clone it locally, and run `npm i` in the root.

To run the tests, run `npm run test`

### Exercise

Test the functions in order, starting with `calculateAge`, followed by `calculateTax` and `greet`.

Ensure you complete success, failure and malformed tests where possible.

Ensure every use case of each function is fully tested.

The functions get progressively harder to test.
